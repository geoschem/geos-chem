# Changelog

This file documents all notable changes to the GEOS-Chem repository since version 13.4.1, including all GEOS-Chem Classic and GCHP run directory updates.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

- Added updates for compatibility with CESM, GEOS, and WRF-GC

### Fixed
- Fixed missing output boundary conditions on first timestep of run
- Added missing entries for POG1, POG2, and pFe to HEMCO_Config.rc
- Reverted GC-Classic pressure fixer to v13.3 to fix bug in v13.4
- Fixed dry deposition of methanol over oceans
- Fixed issues in creating run directory for GCAP2
- Removed duplicate species for SO4 in aciduptake.eqn
- Fixed CEDS_CO2_SHP emissions in HEMCO_Config.rc file for CO2 simulation
- Fixed Volcano_Table entry in HEMCO config template for GCHP
- Fixed transport tracers simulation in GCHP
- Applied fix to avoid divide-by-zero in routine MMR_Compute_FLux
- Fixed HEMCO diagnostic counter zero warnings in full chemistry simulation
- Fixed bug in totalOC diagnostic
- Fixed bugs causing differences when splitting up GC-Classic and GCHP simulations in time
- Fixed bug setting GEOS-FP meteorology in GCHP run directories

### Changed
- Updated KPP to version 2.5.0
- Updated GCHP run scripts to easily segment runs in time
- Changed GCHP restart filename convention to exclude seconds
- Updated offline biogenic VOC and soil NOx emissions
- Reduced root logging level for MAPL from INFO to WARNING
- Changed 4D State_Chm%Species array to vector of 3D concentration arrays
- Renamed GCHP config file runConfig.sh to setCommonRunSettings.sh
- Moved restart file location in run directory to Restarts subdirectory
- Updated sample restart files copied to run directories to 14.0.0 1-year benchmark output

### Removed
- Removed TMPU1, SPHU1, PS1_WET, and PS1_DRY from GC-Classic restart file
