!-----COMMON BLOCKS FOR DEPVEL
!
! NOTES:
! (1 ) Changed RCS ID tag comment character from "C" to "!" to allow freeform
!       compilation.  Also added & continuation characters in column 73
!       to allow header files to be included in F90 freeform files.
!       (bmy, 6/25/02)
! (2 ) Commented out internal variables that are local to DEPVEL since
!       these are now contained within "drydep_mod.f" (bmy, 11/21/02)

      ! NOTE: This should be split off into a "landtype_mod.f"
