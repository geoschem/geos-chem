This directory contains settings used for GCHP run directory creation if using GEOS-IT
meteorology fields. Unlike in GEOS-Chem Classic, GEOS-IT data is available in
native cubed-sphere grid resolution (C180) as well as lat-lon (0.5x0.625). Users
may also choose between using pre-processed files generated specifically for use
with GEOS-Chem, or raw data downloaded directly from GMAO. Pre-processed files
contain the same data as raw GMAO files except are vertically flipped, have
unused fields removed, are concatenated into daily files, and are compressed to
reduce storage requirements.

If using C180 fields, users may also choose whether to use mass fluxes or winds
in advection.

The following files contain the settings for these various options such as
input file paths in ExtData.rc and whether the vertical direction in the file
is down (level 1 = TOA) or up (level 1 = surface). Note that all
raw GMAO data is down while all processed files are up.

A. If using lat-lon files:

  1. geosit.preprocessed_0.5x0.625.txt
     - Processed files
     - 0.5x0.625 grid resolution
     - Vertical direction is up
     - Contains fields used for FV3 advection as well as GEOS-Chem

  2. geosit.raw_0.5x0.625.txt
     - Raw GMAO files
     - 0.5x0.625 grid resolution
     - Vertical direction is down
     - Contains fields used for FV3 advection as well as GEOS-Chem

B. If using cubed-sphere files:

  NOTE: When using C180 fields the settings are split across two different files:
  one file for non-advection fields and another file for advection fields. This
  allows flexibility for using either 1-hourly mass fluxes or 3-hourly winds to
  drive the offline advection.

  1. Non-advection field settings:

    NOTE: Specifies all met-fields except wind, surface pressure,
          humidity, mass flux and Courant numbers

    a. geosit.nonadv_preprocessed_c180.txt
     - Processed files
     - Vertical direction is up

    b. geosit.nonadv_raw_c180.txt
     - Raw GMAO files
     - Vertical directory is down

  2. Advection field settings:

    NOTE: Always specifies wind, surface pressure, and humidity.
          Mass flux and Courant numbers are also specified if GCHP
          is configured to use them.

     a. geosit.preprocessed_3hr_c180_wind.txt
        - Processed files
        - Vertical direction is up

     b. geosit.raw_3hr_c180_wind.txt
        - Raw GMAO files
        - Vertical direction is down

     c. geosit.preprocessed_1hr_c180_mass_flux.txt
        - Processed files
	- Vertical direction is up
   
     d. geosit.raw_1hr_c180_mass_flux.txt
        - Raw GMAO files
	- Vertical direction is down

Each of these files contains some combination of the following settings
used during run directory creation to ultimately populate settings
in GCHP configuration file GCHP.rc:

MET_MASS_FLUX_IS_TOP_DOWN
MET_WIND_IS_TOP_DOWN
MET_HUMIDITY_IS_TOP_DOWN
MET_NONADVECTION_IS_TOP_DOWN
IMPORT_MASS_FLUX_FROM_EXTDATA

Additional files are provided to use on the NASA discover cluster. These are different
than the non-discover files because they have different filenames than those
downloaded from the NASA data portal.
