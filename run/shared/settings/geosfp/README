This directory contains settings used for GCHP run directory creation if using GEOS-FP
meteorology fields. Unlike in GEOS-Chem Classic, GEOS-FP data is by default at native
resolution of 0.25x0.625, and either processed files or raw GMAO files may be used.

In addition, users may swap out the input fields that are used for advection,
specifically surface pressure, humidity, and winds, with raw GMAO data from an hourly
C720 archive that includes mass fluxes and Courant numbers instead of wind. An
additional C720 archive is available containing winds derived from mass fluxes,
created in post-processing specifically for use with GEOS-Chem.

The following files contain the settings for these various options, including
their entries for ExtData.rc (which includes file paths) and whether file
vertical direction is top-down (level 1 TOA) or bottom-up (level 1 surface), and
therefore whether data must be flipped at run-time. Every run configuration will
use one file for non-advection fields (section A below) and one or two files
for advection fields (section B below).

A. Non-advection fields, i.e. no surface pressure, humidity, and wind

  1. geosfp.nonadv_raw_ll.txt
     - Raw GMAO files
     - 0.25x0625 grid resolution
     - Vertical directory is top-down

  2. geosfp.nonadv_preprocessed_ll.txt
     - Processed files
     - 0.25x0625 grid resolution
     - Pre-processed means same as raw GMAO file data except vertically flipped,
       unused fields removed, concatenated into daily files, and compressed
     - Vertical direction is bottom-up

B. Advection fields, i.e. surface pressure, humidity, and either wind or mass fluxes and Courant numbers

  1. 3-hourly 0.25x0.625 fields

     NOTE: Wind is in a separate file from surface pressure and humidity because
     3-hourly wind must still be read if using C720 mass fluxes in advection.
     That archive does not include wind but wind is a requirement in GCHP.

       a. advection_met/geosfp.preprocessed_3hr_0.25x0.625_PS_SPHU.txt
       b. advection_met/geosfp.preprocessed_3hr_0.25x0.625_wind.txt       
          - Pre-processed files only
	  - Vertical direction is bottom-up
	  
       c. advection_met/geosfp.raw_3hr_0.25x0.625_PS_SPHU.txt
       d. advection_met/geosfp.raw_3hr_0.25x0.625_wind.txt
          - Raw GMAO files only
          - Vertical direction is top-down

  2. 1-hourly C720 fields

       a. advection_met/geosfp.raw_1hr_0.25x0.625_mass_flux_PS_SPHU_C.txt
          - Raw GMAO files only
	  - Vertical direction is top-down

       b. advection_met/geosfp.derived_1hr_c720_wind_PS_SPHU.txt
          - Wind is in pre-processed files
	  - Surface pressure and humidity are from the raw GMAO C720 archive
	  - Vertical direction is top-down
