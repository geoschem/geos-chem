This directory contains settings used for GCHP run directory creation if using GEOS-FP
meteorology fields. Unlike in GEOS-Chem Classic, GEOS-FP data is by default at native
resolution of 0.25x0.3125, and either processed files or raw GMAO files may be used. Processed means same as except vertically flipped, unused fields removed, concatenated into daily files, and compressed.

In addition, users may swap out the input fields that are used for advection,
specifically surface pressure, humidity, and winds, with raw GMAO data from an hourly
C720 archive that includes mass fluxes and Courant numbers instead of wind. An
additional C720 archive is available containing winds derived from mass fluxes,
created in post-processing specifically for use with GEOS-Chem. Note that the derived winds file, though processed, is not vertically flipped relative to the C720 mass flux archive.

The following files contain the settings for these various options, including
their entries for ExtData.rc (which includes file paths) and whether file
vertical direction is top-down (level 1 TOA) or bottom-up (level 1 surface), and
therefore whether data must be flipped at run-time. Every run configuration will
use one file for non-advection fields (section A below) and one or two files
for advection fields (section B below), such that source of humidity, wind, and
other met-fields are always specified.

A. Non-advection fields, i.e. no surface pressure, humidity, and wind

  1. geosfp.nonadv_raw_ll.txt
     - Raw GMAO files
     - 0.25x0.3125 grid resolution

  2. geosfp.nonadv_preprocessed_ll.txt
     - Processed files
     - 0.25x0.3125 grid resolution

B. Advection fields

  1. 3-hourly 0.25x0.3125 fields

       a. advection_met/geosfp.preprocessed_3hr_0.25x0.3125_PS_SPHU.txt
       b. advection_met/geosfp.preprocessed_3hr_0.25x0.3125_wind.txt       
          - Pre-processed files only
	  
       c. advection_met/geosfp.raw_3hr_0.25x0.3125_PS_SPHU.txt
       d. advection_met/geosfp.raw_3hr_0.25x0.3125_wind.txt
          - Raw GMAO files only

  2. 1-hourly C720 fields

       a. advection_met/geosfp.raw_1hr_0.25x0.3125_mass_flux_PS_SPHU_C.txt
          - Raw GMAO files only

       b. advection_met/geosfp.derived_1hr_c720_wind_PS_SPHU.txt
          - Wind is in pre-processed file while surface pressure and
	    humidity are in the raw GMAO C720 archive

Each of these files contains some combination of the following settings
used during run directory creation to ultimately populate settings
in GCHP configuration file GCHP.rc:

MET_MASS_FLUX_IS_TOP_DOWN
MET_WIND_IS_TOP_DOWN
MET_HUMIDITY_IS_TOP_DOWN
MET_NONADVECTION_IS_TOP_DOWN
IMPORT_MASS_FLUX_FROM_EXTDATA
