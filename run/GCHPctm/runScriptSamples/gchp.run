# Resource request tips: 
#  (1) Use #SBATCH -n 6 to request 6 cores total across all nodes
#  (2) Use #SBATCH --exclusive to prevent other users from sharing nodes in use
#      (ability to use --exclusive may be disabled on some clusters)
#  (3) Use --mem=50G to request 50 Gigabytes per node, 
#      or use --mem=MaxMemPerNode to request all memory per node
#  (4) Performance is enhanced by requesting entire nodes and all memory
#      even if GCHP is run on fewer cores per node than available.
